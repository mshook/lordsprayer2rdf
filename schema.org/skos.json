This paper presents the main components of SKOS and their formal expression in Web Ontology Language (OWL), providing an extensive account of the design decisions taken by the Semantic Web Deployment (SWD) Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which between 2006 and 2009 brought SKOS to the status of W3C Recommendation. The paper explains key design principles such as \"minimal ontological commitment\" and systematically cites the requirements and issues that influenced the design of SKOS components.\r\n\r\nBy reconstructing the discussion around alternative features and design options and presenting the rationale for design decisions, the paper aims at providing insight into how SKOS turned out as it did, and why. Assuming that SKOS, like any other successful technology, may eventually be subject to revision and improvement, the critical account offered here may help future editors approach such a task with deeper understanding."}],"https://schema.org/keywords":[{"@value":"SKOS"},{"@value":"Simple Knowledge Organization System"},{"@value":"Knowledge Organization Systems"},{"@value":"KOS"},{"@value":"thesauri"},{"@value":"classification schemes"},{"@value":"Semantic Web"},{"@value":"Web Ontology Language"},{"@value":"OWL"},{"@value":"design decisions"},{"@value":"W3C Recommendation"},{"@value":"minimal ontological commitment"}],"https://schema.org/genre":[{"@value":"Academic Paper"},{"@value":"Research Article"}],"https://schema.org/inLanguage":[{"@value":"en"}],"https://schema.org/dateCreated":[{"@value":"2006/2009","@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearRange"}],"https://schema.org/publisher":[{"@id":"http://njh.me/#w3c"}],"https://schema.org/isPartOf":[{"@id":"http://njh.me/#semantic-web-research"}],"https://schema.org/mentions":[{"@id":"http://njh.me/#skos-topic"},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#w3c"},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#swd-working-group"},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#owl"},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#thesauri"},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#classification-schemes"},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#minimal-ontological-commitment"}]},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#classification-schemes","@type":["https://schema.org/Thing"],"https://schema.org/name":[{"@value":"Classification Schemes"}],"https://schema.org/description":[{"@value":"Systems for organizing and categorizing knowledge"}],"https://schema.org/additionalType":[{"@id":"https://schema.org/CategoryCode"}]},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#minimal-ontological-commitment","@type":["https://schema.org/Thing"],"https://schema.org/name":[{"@value":"Minimal Ontological Commitment"}],"https://schema.org/description":[{"@value":"Key design principle for SKOS development"}],"https://schema.org/additionalType":[{"@id":"https://schema.org/Concept"}]},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#owl","@type":["https://schema.org/Thing"],"https://schema.org/name":[{"@value":"Web Ontology Language"}],"https://schema.org/alternateName":[{"@value":"OWL"}],"https://schema.org/description":[{"@value":"Web standard for expressing ontologies"}],"https://schema.org/additionalType":[{"@id":"https://schema.org/ComputerLanguage"}]},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#semantic-web-research","@type":["https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries"],"https://schema.org/name":[{"@value":"Semantic Web Research"}],"https://schema.org/description":[{"@value":"Academic research area focusing on semantic web technologies and applications"}],"https://schema.org/genre":[{"@value":"Academic Research Field"}]},{"@id":"http://njh.me/#skos-topic","@type":["https://schema.org/Thing"],"https://schema.org/name":[{"@value":"Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)"}],"https://schema.org/description":[{"@value":"A data model and vocabulary for expressing Knowledge Organization Systems such
