Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but she always left them on the floor when she was done. Her mommy would always tell her to clean up her toys, but Lily never listened.
One day, Lily's friend came over to play. Her friend was being very rude and not sharing her toys. Lily wanted to play with her friend's toys, but her mommy told her to put her toys away. Lily didn't want to, but her mommy explained that it was important to be kind and share with others.
After Lily finished cleaning up, she went to play with her friend. Her friend's mommy came in and told them to talk about how important it is to listen and be kind to others. Lily remembered her mommy's words and decided to be a better friend and always be kind to others. From that day on, Lily made sure to clean up her toys before she went to bed.
