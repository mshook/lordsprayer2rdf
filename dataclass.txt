● @dataclass is a Python decorator (introduced in Python 3.7) that automatically generates common methods
  for classes that primarily store data.

  Without @dataclass, you'd write:
  class Petition:
      def __init__(self, text, order, concerns, label=None):
          self.text = text
          self.order = order
          self.concerns = concerns
          self.label = label

  With @dataclass, you just write:
  @dataclass
  class Petition:
      text: str
      order: int
      concerns: str
      label: Optional[str] = None

  It automatically generates:
  - __init__() method
  - __repr__() method (for string representation)
  - __eq__() method (for equality comparison)
  - Other utility methods

  The type hints (str, int, etc.) are required syntax for dataclasses and document what type each field
  should be.
