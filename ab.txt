The source explores an evolutionary model of meaning and reason, primarily informed by the work of Sperber and Mercier (S&M), which frames the human attachment to abstract truth as a profound philosophical puzzle. According to S&M, reasoning did not evolve to seek logical consistency but serves essential social purposes, largely helping individuals rationalize existing preferences and enhance their social status. Their theory describes a mechanical progression of thought, built upon non-conscious "inferences" (causal chains of neural responses), which accounts for the development of cognitive complexity all the way from worm to Wittgenstein. Ultimately, this framework suggests that while basic organisms can process information, true human reasoning—and the capacity for self-deception or the explicit pursuit of abstract ideas—requires language.
